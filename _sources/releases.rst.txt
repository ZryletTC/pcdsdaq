Next Release
============

Features
--------
- Allow ``ctrl+c`` during a `begin` call with ``wait=True`` to stop the run.
- Add sourcable `pcdsdaq_lib_setup` script that will get `pydaq` and `pycdb`
  ready for your python environment.
- The `connect` method will provide more helpful error messages when it fails.

Deprecations
